# NSCAN: News-Stock Cross-Attention Network

This project implements a novel approach to predicting multiple stock returns simultaneously using Large Language Models and financial news data. Unlike traditional approaches that predict returns for individual stocks in isolation, our model captures cross-asset relationships and market interactions.

__NOTE:__ This project is in the very early stages of development.
